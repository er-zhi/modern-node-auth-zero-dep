## Disclaimer: I just want to demonstrate what can be achieved with vanilla Node.js. This isn't necessarily the best approachâ€”it's more of a proof of concept. The code could be better structured and written, but my goal isn't to reinvent the wheel or build my own framework. This is purely a practice exercise in working with JWT.
